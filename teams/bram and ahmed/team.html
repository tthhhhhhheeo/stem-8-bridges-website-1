        <h1>spagetti bridges  </h1>
             
        
        
        in this bridge building 
        competition we are trying 
        to make a bridge that can hold
        the most weight and weigh the 
        least we can only make these
        bridges out of spegetti and 
        hot glue, we are given 250 
        sticks of spagetti and 5 hot
        glue sticks our bridge must be
        less than 20 cm high 10 cm 
        wide and 60 cm long .

        we are using the truss bridge design for our project we then test it by putting it in a press to see how mutch weight it can hold.

        our bridge supprted a total of 3 pounds we think that the faliure was due to the support at the corners where the bridge is under the most pressure also not all corners could reach the egdes of the ravine so we assume this was a factor too.

        we test our bridges strength by crushing it with a press the computer reads how mutch weight the bridge sustains before it crumples.
        the truss design we landed on was the warren truss becuase is is simple and it can be modifyed to fit many roles.

        for our second bridge deign we dicided to modify our first design becuse we thought it was a good design but could have had slight changes an it was not exicuted optimaly
