<h1>Design process for bridge 2</h1>







<p>For the second bridge, we started to take into account about why our first bridge failed and trying to improve on those things on the second one. So we made each of our Spaghetti bars 5 strands thick instead of 2, and we made sure all the angles were even to that the bridge wouldn't be slanted or curved at the end.</p>
