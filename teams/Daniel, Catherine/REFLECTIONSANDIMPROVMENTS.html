<h1>Bridge 1 Reflection</h1>
<h3> ANALYSIS:</h3>
<p>The first bridges cross members worked well, with only one bar breaking on the top by the crusher. This is because we made the bars thick and the joints there were well glued togther there.Something that didn't work with this bridge was how had bucked in between the middle of the structure and one of the adbutments. This is mainly because of joint fail </p>
<h3> IMPROVEMENTS:</h3>
