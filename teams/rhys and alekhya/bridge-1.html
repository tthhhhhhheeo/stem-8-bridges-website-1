        <p>
            hello we're Alekhya and Rhys we are trying to building a strong bridge for a school project. or goal is to
            make a bridge with the constraints where given like it has to be 10cm or less wide . the hight as to be 20cm
            or less and the lenght has to be 50- 60 cm. We were also only givin 125g of spagetti and 5 hot glue sticks
        </p>

        <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue">Members</h2>
        <p>Rhys: i make the sketches for the bridge and i helped glue and build the bridge along with alekhya.</p>
        <p>
            Alekhya: I make the outlines for the bridge and also help glue it together on the coding side I write the
            code for the bridge website
        </p>

        <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue">How its tested</h2>
        <p>In this project bridges are put under weight by this machine</p>
        <p><img src="IMG_2651.jpg" width="200px" /></p>
        <p>
            the machien uses a hydrolic jack to push down the bar. which puts presure on the little square on the
            bottom. the square under the bar has 4 sensors that transfer how much weiight is put on it in pounds.
        </p>

        <p>this is the template we used</p>

        <p>this is the view through the middle of the bridge</p>

        <p>this is the arial view of the bridge</p>
        <p><img src="test 1/IMG_2620.jpg" width="200px" /></p>
        <p>this is the view of the bottom of our bridge</p>
        <p>
            the reason we chose this design is that there are a lot of triangals which is the strongest shape. we also
            added cross bars to stabilize the middle areas.
        </p>

        <h3 style="background-color: lightcyan">Statistics</h3>
        <p>Hight = 18 cm</p>
        <p>Length = 56 cm</p>
        <p>Width = 16 cm</p>
        <p>Weight = 184 g</p>
        <p>Held = 5.455 kg</p>
        <p>Score = 29.6</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: lightcyan">How It Failed</h3>
        <p>
            the bridge was over the with limit width was a facture of why it failed but we also need to make it stronger
            in the middle. Bt also to get a better score we'd make it lighter
        </p>
        <h3 style="background-color: lightcyan">Summary</h3>
        <p>
            in our first test we found out we can make some superts thinner. we also need to figure out a way to make
            the center stronger.

        <p>Hight = 19 cm</p>
        <p>Length = 53 cm</p>
        <p>Width = 7 cm</p>
        <p>Weight = 144 g</p>
        <p>Held = 8.5 kg</p>
        <p>Score = 59</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: lavender">How It Failed</h3>
        <p>it faild by poor gluing and the bars in the middle snaped</p>
        <p> this is the bridge after being crushed</p>

         <h3 style="background-color: lavender">Summary</h3>
        <p>From this test we found that the cross bars work and that we need 
        to double check the glue bettween the joints. also we'd make the bars in the center bigger.</p>
