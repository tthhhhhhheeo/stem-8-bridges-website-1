        <p>
            hello we're Alekhya and Rhys we are trying to building a
            strong bridge for a school project.
            or goal is to make a bridge with the constraints where given
            like it has to be 10cm or less wide . the hight as to be 20cm or less and the
            lenght has to be 50- 60 cm.
            We were also only givin 125g of spagetti and 5 hot glue sticks
        </p>
        
        
        <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue;">Members</h2>
        <p> Rhys: i make the sketches for the bridge and i helped glue 
            and build the bridge along with alekhya.</p>
        <p>
        Alekhya: I make the outlines for the bridge and also help glue it together
            on the coding side I write the code for the bridge website</p>
           
            <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue;">How its tested</h2>
            <p>In this project bridges are put under weight by this machine</p>
            <p><img src="IMG_2651.jpg" width=200px></p>
            <p> the machien uses a hydrolic jack to push down the bar.
            which puts presure on the little square on the bottom. 
                the square under the bar has 4 sensors that transfer how 
            much weiight is put on it in pounds.</p>

                <p>this is the template we used</p>
                    <h3 style="background-color:lightcyan;">Statistics</h3>
                    <p>Hight = 18 cm</p>
                    <p>Length = 56 cm</p>
                    <p>Width = 16 cm</p>
                    <p>Weight = 184 g</p>  
                    <p>Held = 5.455 kg</p>
                    <p>Score = 29.6</p>
                        <h3 style="background-color:lightcyan;">How It Failed</h3>
                        <p>
                        the bridge was over the with limit width was 
                            a facture of why it failed
                        but we also need to make it stronger in the middle.
                            Bt also to get a better score we'd make it lighter
                        </p>

                            <p>
                              in our first test we found out we can make some
                                superts thinner. 
                            we also need to figure out
                                a way to make the center stronger.
