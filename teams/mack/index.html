            Efficient transportation is crucial for our society, and I find bridges to be impressive examples of civil
            engineering innovation. In this project, my goal is to design and build a spaghetti bridge that achieves the
            highest possible score using the formula: Score = Mass Supported by Bridge (g) / Mass of Bridge (kg).<br />
       <br />BRIDGE #1<br />
<br />I started my project by looking for a good spaghetti bridge design. After checking out different styles, I found a classic arch bridge that looked strong and cool. Once I decided on that design, I drew a detailed diagram and got excited to start bringing my bridge idea to life!

Since the bridge was a spaghetti bridge I built it using spaghetti and a hot glue gun.  I took some basic measurements and then I started on one side.  When that was done I built the other side.  The shape of my bridge looked like a "chopped-in-half-half" Ferris wheel.  I glued both sides together using cross bridges.  I tried to use only triangles (no squares or rectangles) because triangles are stronger and can hold more weight.  

When I finished it, the bridge was a little short for the crusher we were using (this crusher tested bridge strength).  I had to "panic attach" a bunch of random pieces to each end so it would be long enough.  During the test, the two end bits broke off and my bridge did not get the opportunity to be crush tested fully.  

I learned to double-check that the next bridge I built was long enough and to use even more triangles for added strength.<br />  
<br />BRIDGE #2<br />
<br />For my second bridge, I remembered from the previous test there was one bridge that got a good crush test score.  It was a "chopped in half" triangle shape.  I decided to build a style of bridge for my second attempt.  

I took the design paper over to the crusher and measured the width of the crusher.  Then I took the paper and put it on the table and drew my new design to scale.  With my drawn bridge on the paper, I laid the spaghetti on the paper and glued the spaghetti together following my design.  I built both sides the same and again used cross-members to connect both sides.
