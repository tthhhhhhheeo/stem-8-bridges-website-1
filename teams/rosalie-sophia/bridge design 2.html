    <p>For our second bridge design we looked for a more detailed bridge design specifically one with a rounded top as we saw that worked well for our peers. We settled on the camelback design. This is what our template looked like: </p>

    <p> When building out the trusses we made a mistake on the second truss and it was not symmetrical to the first truss. So we had to re-do the second truss. *show pictures* We cut down the amount of spaghetti we used and limited it to 3 pieces of spaghetti for the areas on the bridge under compression and only 2 for tension.
We found that building the outline for the bridge is a lot faster and easier to build when re-doing the second truss. We will definitely be bringing that knowledge into our third and final bridge design.
