    <div><h6>Pratt Truss Design</h6></div>
    <div><h6>Our Design with spaghetti</h6></div>
</div>
<p> When we started building our first bridge, we took a careful approach to our design process. Our goal was to find the most straightforward and basic design available, one that could still support some weight. After exploring different options, we settled on a pratt truss design.
</p>
<p> When tested, Our bridge was much too heavy and large because we layered the spaghetti with 5 pieces for each column.Because of our design errors, the bridge received a mediocre score of around 16.
</p>
<p>We should have figured out how much spaghetti we needed instead of using all of our materials for the sake of it. On our next bridge, we will focus more on compression and tension points on the bridge, and what we can do to make it stronger.
</p>
<h3>The Construction Process</h3>

<p>We started out by making a template to plan what bridge we were going to make.</p>

<p>We then began building the bridge. First, we made the outline of truss number 1, then filled it in with the planned spaghetti. We did the same with the second truss, then attached the two sides in the way the picture above shows.</p>
