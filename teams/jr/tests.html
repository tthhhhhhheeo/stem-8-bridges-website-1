     Test#1
     </h3>
        <h4>
        Our firt proto type failed due to the compression on the center of the bridge, this and a joint failure caused 
        our bridge to colapse. For our second itoration we will be trying to make the joints stronger and useing more 
        spagetti on the places that it broke at as well as renenforcements along the whole thing as well as extra spaghetti for
        the places where its needed. unforchantly we where disquilyfied beacause of the width be to wide.

        Test#2
        </h3>
        <h4>
        our second test went worse due to the lack of speed and rupert missed the last day so jack had to glue the 
        crossmembers alone. and someone taxed 3 of our glue sticks, it scored 14. although the test was not very successfull mr 
        Hengaveld supplied us with infromation which proved to be quite useful.
