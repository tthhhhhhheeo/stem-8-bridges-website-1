        <h3>
         hello we're Rupert and Jack we are trying to build a fortified, sturdy and strong bridge for an educational
            school project. Our goal is to pursue the difficult challenge of creating a bridge with the strict
            constraints and restrictions our elite groupe has been given. These constraints are that the width of are
            spagehtti has to be 10cm or less width, this is just one example of the many constraints and restrictions
            are group has been provided with to increase the challenge and increase our skills in engineering. All of
            the constraints that are groupe has been provided with is that the hight must be 20cm or less and the length
            has to be 50- 60 cm. We also where given a tiny amount of material such as 125g of spagetti with
            the adition of 5 whole hot glue sticks.
